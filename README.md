## Gameplay hints

- every TSL civilization is viable.
- every region provides all strategic resources in a sufficient amount. The exceptions are that only European powers will have access to horses and only the native civilizations will have easy access to uranium.
- luxury resources are grouped and limited to certain regions. Every nation will be able to get its hands on multiple luxury resources of the same type to trade them away but also is depending on imports.
- rising sea levels are more dangerous since they are able to reach further inland than usual.
- there are three locations that allow for a connection between the Atlantic with the Pacific.
- look for reefs if you can't find mountains for your campus.
- there is a certain island group that provides great science yields.
- if you can't get a certain luxury resource from another civilization you may want to look for a city state in the same region.
- Astecs will find some city states and a helpful natural wonder to unleash their early warmongering potential
- Spain's capital is positioned on a different continent to get their civilization bonus kicking in early on. An nearby natural wonder will help them in their quest for a religious victory. Chances for a golden age in the second era to boost religion is high.
- Incas starting area is very powerful with lots of hills and mountains for their terrace farm. Make use of their Qhapaq Ã‘an to access natural wonders and city states for improved trade routes. To offset their strong starting area they will have to fight a lot of snow storms. It is also the only civilization with desert tiles near by.
- With France you may want to take advantage of industries to boost their cultural output. They are a little isolated and will probably be left alone for most of the game. Just make sure to keep an eye on the sea level. Florida is no high ground.
- Maya's my find enough spots for plantations to make good use of their observatories. There is also enough land tiles surrounding your capital to support a lot of cities.
- Both England and the Netherlands start on relatively small islands but they will allow for optimized city layouts if planned properly in advance. Both nations will face similar challenges. Teaming up for trade (there is even a place to take advantage of a certain bridge!) or facing off in an early war for expansion is both possible. Eventually, both will have to set sail, though.

## Known issues

- since there are only a few city-states, barbarians may overwhelm A.I. opponents, especially on lower difficulties.
- wars happen only very late in the game because the map is too large for border conflicts early on (too late to change that. I am still learning. Sorry.)

Please feel free to leave me some feedback if you run into issues or stuff that should work better.
